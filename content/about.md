Nice to meet you! I am Trevor Nederlof a geospatial developer who is passionate about equitable access to food and transportation.

Currently I am working towards my master's degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I am studying GIS Development. I am particularly interested in the intersection of geospatial analysis, data visualization, and software development. My research and development efforts are now focused on how transportation networks can be developed to provide more equitable access, a sustainable enviornment and greater food security.

The first chapter of my career was in financial services, where I saw the value of well thought out data analysis and visualization. Over the years I discovered just how universally applicable data-related skills were to not just my specific needs but in other industries as well. After using Excel, R, Matlab, and Python in my career I saw how effective programming and data engineering were to solving a variety of problems.
