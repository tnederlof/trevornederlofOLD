Nice to meet you! I am a geospatial developer who has spent my career diagnosing client problems and using technology to chart a new path forward. I am passionate about contributing to open-source tools and believe they are crucial to creating a more equitable and sustainable future.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of geospatial analysis, data visualization, and software development. My current development efforts focus on transforming transit networks to reduce the reliance on cars and encourage active travel.

The first chapter of my career was in financial services, where I saw the value of well-thought-out data analysis and visualization. Over the years, I discovered just how universally applicable data-related skills were. After using R, Python, and SQL in my career, I saw how helpful programming and data engineering were to solve problems across various domains.
