In my work for Farm 2 Facts, I researched how COVID impacted child food insecurity across the Midwest. Children experiencing food insecurity often face serious developmental issues impacting them for their entire lives. This research culminated in a Farm 2 Facts blog post containing a thematic choropleth map.

Farm 2 Facts is an organization that provides farmers market managers with a toolkit to help them collect data, inform decisions, and communicate with stakeholders, so they achieve their market goals. Organizations include city- or state-wide farmers market organizations or any other organization that oversees multiple farmers markets.
