![African Political Map](/img/african_political_map.png)

This is a map I created during a cartography class to show the political boundaries of countries in Africa along with capitals and major cities. The labels required were quite dense, which demanded creativity with the label placement. Also, I created a color scheme to help differentiate countries from one another without being overly distracting from the labels and other important information.
