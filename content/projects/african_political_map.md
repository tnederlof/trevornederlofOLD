![African Political Map](/img/african_political_map.png)

This is a map I created during a cartography class to show the political boundaries of countries in Africa along with capitals and major cities. The labels required were quite dense, so there was lots of time spent on how to place each label. Also, I created a color scheme to help differentiate countries from one another without being overly distracting from labels and other important information.
