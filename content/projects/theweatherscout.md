[The Weather Scout](https://www.theweatherscout.com) is a website I created to help myself and others in the backpacking community discover likely weather patterns based on historical data.

The site combines detailed historical weather data with a powerful interactive map and location search tool. This tool provides an easy-to-use exploration of likely weather across the United States.

Technically the site is developed in Elixir using the Phoenix web framework. The frontend consists of interactive maps based on Mapbox GL and used Javascript charts.
