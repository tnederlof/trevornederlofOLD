[The Weather Scout](https://www.theweatherscout.com) is a website I created to help myself and others in the backpacking community explore weather patterns based on climate data. The site combines detailed historical weather data with a powerful interactive map and location search tool to explore across the United States.

Technically the backend of the site is developed in Elixir using the Phoenix web framework and backed by a PostgreSQL database. The frontend consists of HTML/CSS for templateing, interactive maps based on Mapbox GL, and charts using Javascript.
