[The Weather Scout](https://www.theweatherscout.com) is website I created to help myself and others in the backpacking community discover likely weather patterns for a location based on historical data.

The site combines detailed historical weather data with a powerful interactive map and location search tool. This tool provides an easy to use method of historical weather exploration all over the United States.

Technically the site was developed in Elixir using the Phoenix web framework. The frontend consisting of interactive maps and charts are javascript which interact with the Elixir backend.
