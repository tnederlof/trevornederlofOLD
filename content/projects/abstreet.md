[A/B Street](https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet) describes itself as...

"Ever been stuck in traffic on a bus, wondering why is there legal street parking instead of a dedicated bus lane? A/B Street is a game exploring how small changes to a city affect the movement of drivers, cyclists, transit users, and pedestrians. It works anywhere in the world, thanks to OpenStreetMap."

This game/simulation was created by Dustin Carlino and written in Rust. I have participated in design discussions, feature development and submitted successfully many pull requests into the project.
